# Ludo

## Architecture
The game is mainly build by three different building blocks (Directories): GameApplication, Players, and GameItems. 

### GameApplication
This directory consists of the classes Game, GameRules and GameUI. 

- Game has the overall responsibility to run the game. 

- GameRules is responsible to keep track of things that have to do with logic concerning rules e.g. like if Tokens are moveable and about to finish.

- GameUI creates and prints a UI and the main menu.
